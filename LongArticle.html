      Artificial Intelligence (<mark>AI</mark>) is transforming the world in ways we never imagined. 
      From self-driving cars to intelligent personal assistants, AI is revolutionizing the way we 
      interact with technology and shaping the future of human innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The integration of <mark>machine learning</mark> and <mark>data analytics</mark> has enabled systems 
      to process information and make decisions faster than ever before. As a result, industries such as 
      healthcare, education, and finance are experiencing a paradigm shift toward automation and smart systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, as AI continues to grow, concerns about <mark>ethics</mark> and <mark>job displacement</mark> 
      have emerged. Many experts believe that while AI can replace certain repetitive tasks, it will also 
      create new opportunities in research, engineering, and creative sectors.

    <blockquote>
      “Artificial intelligence is likely to be either the best or worst thing to happen to humanity.”  
      — Stephen Hawking
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      One of the key challenges in AI development is ensuring that systems act responsibly. 
      Governments and organizations are working together to create <mark>AI governance frameworks</mark> 
      that promote fairness, transparency, and accountability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking ahead, the potential of AI is limitless. With continued innovation, 
      we may see advancements that revolutionize everything from space exploration to 
      environmental sustainability. The goal is not to replace humans, but to work 
      alongside them to achieve a smarter, more connected world.
